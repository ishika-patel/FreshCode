OOP Notes
 
 - data stored in an object are called data members
    - data members are encapsulated: hidden from other parts of thr program and only acessible through own member functions
 - functions that work on data members are member functions
 
 class defenition - header file ClassName.h
 
 #ifndef CLASSNAME_H
 #definw CLASSNAME_H
 
     class NameOfClass {
     public:
     // the public interfase
     private
     // data members
     }
endif 
     
 mutators: modifies the data members of the object (set method)
 accessor: function that queries data (get method) const;
 
 implementatition file
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iomanip>
 #include "CLASSNAME.h"
 using namespace std;
 
 driver file: includes the main
 
 compile from commmand line (because you are combining multiple files)
    - save before compiling in command line
    - only the cpp files in the g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp filename.cpp
    - unity.cpp just has the include statements
    
turn in .h, .cpp and driver
